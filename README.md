# 🧠 Epoch50 Project

**Epoch50 Project** is a self-directed, 50-week learning marathon focused on mastering the foundations and frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Each week is dedicated to completing a high-quality course, reading, or implementation challenge, with structured notes and code captured in Jupyter notebooks.

The goal is to build deep, practical, and theoretical understanding across a wide range of topics — from classical ML to advanced deep learning and reinforcement learning.
